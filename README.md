## Create a visual representation of your tasks :)

#### This MATLAB script will create a Gantt chat to help you visualize your tasks and in addition to planning how to approach them, get a comprehensive idea of your work schedule. The appearance of the chart can be adjusted depending on user preference. By default, the blocks are blue and the text for the task names is white. 

### Usage Guide

#### Set the inputs to run the code. The variables tasks, startTimes, and endTimes should be arrays e.g., tasks = {'update presentation', 'conference', 'exam prep'}, startTimes = [2,5,7], endTimes = [15,9,20]. The numbers represent the given day of the month so 5 would represent the 5th day of the month. The input totalDays is used for scaling and will depend on how many days are in a particular month.
